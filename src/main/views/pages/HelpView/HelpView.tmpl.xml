                            The game is dedicated to the great donuts and Homer, their biggest fan.
                            Please help Homer not to stay hungry.
                            In single-player mode you need to throw in Homer as many donuts as possible, so that he does not feel sad.
                            But there are only few donuts, so do not miss.
                            In battle mode help Homer to eat more donuts than your opponent can do it.
                            Otherwise, Homer does not want to be friends with you.
